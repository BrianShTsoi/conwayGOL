    <h1>CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE</h1>
    <p class="description">
        Invented by Cambridge mathetician John Horton Conway in 1970, 
        the Game of Life is a zero-player game that demonstrates 
        how complexity can arise from a few simple rules.

        <br>
        This webpage implements the Game of Life using simple HTML, CSS and javascript
        <br>
        The rules of the game can be summarized in 2 lines:
        <ul>
            <li>
                A living cell remains alive if and only if it has two or three neighbours.
            </li>
            <li>
                A dead cell becomes alive if and only if it has three neighbours.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
